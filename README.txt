The code from LibraryUI.java was given, but the code in LibraryModel.java was done by me. Using JDBC the program allows users to view and modify the Database which is using PostgreSQL as the DBMS by running the LibraryUI.java file.
I used Prepared Statements so that the user input couldn't be used for malicous purposes such as SQL Injections.
